# Verification of converter script

- Collection of tripeptide .xyz files from PEPCONF dataset in /tripeptide

1. ("PEPCONF, a diverse data set of peptide conformational energies")[https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018310]

Appears to be strong agreement between energy from LAMMPS thermo and Ambertools cpptraj for a converted peptide (Total -149.4593 in cpptraj, -149.350 in LAMMPS).
